# 📘 Konoz | Student Attendance and Management System

## 🔢 Description
This project is a **student management system** built with **Flet** (Python GUI framework) and **SQLite** (local database). It manages **student attendance**, **student information**, and allows **synchronization with a server** for backup or collaboration.

The system offers:
- 👨‍🎓 **Add new students** to different sections (First, Second, Third secondary grades).
- 🗓️ **Track attendance and absences** for each student.
- 💻 **Synchronize** local data with a remote **Flask server** over HTTP and WebSocket.
- 📦 **Upload and download** student databases (`data.db`, `DONT OPEN.db`) to/from the server.
- 📊 **Export data** to **Excel files** (.xlsx) for reporting.
- 🔐 **User authentication** (login/logout system) to protect administrative actions.
- 🎨 **Modern UI** using Flet with **dark/light theme switcher**.
- 🏷️ **Automatic day detection** (e.g., Friday = "Holiday", Saturday = "Alpha Center", etc.).
- 📸 **Student photo management**, with image uploads and display inside dialogs.
- 🛠️ **Edit and update** student records inside the database.
- 📨 **Send files and attendance lists** to the server.
- 🛡️ **Server availability detection** (e.g., server online/offline status).
- 📋 **Local client storage** (save attendance temporarily using Flet's `client_storage`).
